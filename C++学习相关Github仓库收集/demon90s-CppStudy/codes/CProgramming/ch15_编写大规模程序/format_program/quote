C	is quirky,    floawed,    and an
enormous success.		while accidents of    history
 surely   helped,   it evidently	satisfied   a   need
 		for a    system   implementation	language   efficient
  enough to		displace			assembly   language,
     yet sufficiently    abstract	and fluent 	to describe
	algorithms	and		  interactions    int a wide	variety
of 	  environments.
